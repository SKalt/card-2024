<blockquote>
<p>A spaceship hewn from an asteroid has a billion-year-long mission to build a wormhole network across the galaxy.
Its crew remains frozen for millennia unless a job arises that's too complicated for automated systems to handle.
It has been millions of years since anything remotely human came out of a recently-built wormhole or even tried to communicate.
When the ship receives a signal, it wakes the crew up.</p>
