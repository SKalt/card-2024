The thrilling sequel to "Open Up Some Awesome, Vol. 1", this pamphlet introduced me to the four types of fun:


- Type 1 fun is fun in now and after the activity's done.
- Type 2 fun is not fun now, but it is fun after you're done.
- Type 3 fun is fun now, but is not fun later.
- Type 4 fun is not fun now, nor is it fun later.
