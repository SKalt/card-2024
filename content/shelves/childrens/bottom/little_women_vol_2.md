So I stole this from my parent's house.  But is it really stealing if the inscription on the inside of the cover is written to me?! So I guess I recovered this from my parent's house.  I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this one, as I thought it would be super antiquated with the role of women in society.  But the female characters are quite strong, and there are definitely some funny parts--some that I think Alcott intentionally meant to be funny and others that just didn't age well. I loved all the characters.
