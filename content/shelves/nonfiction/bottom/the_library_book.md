This is the first book I started and finished in 2024.  A non-fiction book about books which started the book about books craze of 2024. It's about a mysterious library fire at a Los Angeles public library branch. Orlean does some heavy duty research and pulls together a compelling story for the cause of the fire.  In between, there are some chapters about the wonderful services the library has to offer and why it is such an important institution to support. - Emma
