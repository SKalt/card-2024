Anything by Atul Gawande is fantastic, but this one is my favorite. - Emma

If you or anyone you know will eventually die, I'd recommend reading this book.
I hadn't considered that there might be an art to dying, or that one could die well without e.g. a heroic last stand.
I'm not looking forward to using the advice in this book[^1] but I expect the advice will eventually come in useful. - Steven

[^1]: summarized: understand what parts of your life you want to prioritize preserving, have a plan, hospice is the way to go.
