> Shilts declined to be told the results of his HIV test until he had completed the writing of And the Band Played On, concerned that the test result, whatever it might be, would interfere with his objectivity as a writer. He was finally found to be HIV positive in March 1987.

I'm surprised the author kept himself in the dark. The history is written like a disaster movie, with you watching the catastrophe unfold while discovering the heroes and villains in their otherwise-normal lives.

I'm still (2024) reading this, since it's effectively a textbook.
