Picked this up because it is stuff that William Osler said. Osler was one of the founding physicians of Johns Hopkins Hospital. He wasn't the best dude, but I was intrigued.  We found this randomly at a used bookstore in San Antonino, TX. We were there for a friend's wedding, who also happened to train at Hopkins with me, so I guess that's fitting. - Emma
