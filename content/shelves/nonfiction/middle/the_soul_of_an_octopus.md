This is high up on the list to read in 2025.  I picked this up at Litchfield Books in Pawley's Island, SC when I was visiting my parents.  My mom sent me out to the grocery store next door to the bookstore and I couldn't not go in. I did read Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt this year--Shout out to my mom's Debourdieu book club for another great read. Van Pelt cites Soul of an Octopus as an important resource in the writing of her book. Another octopus book I'd recommend is The Mountain in the Sea by Ray Nayler. It's a first contact story with some remarkably bright octopuses. I recommendeded it to Steven immediately after I finished it, and he loved it.  However, now Steven feels that all other books in the cyberpunk genre are ruined for me because this book was actually good as opposed to the other cyberpunk that we have that Steven says is "quite bad." - Emma
