I read this because it is mentioned in The Premonition by Michael Lewis. Apparently, George Bush read this while he was president and thought it would be a good idea to make a pandemic task force, just in case. Trump then disbanded this task force... I wouldn't really recommend anyone read this book; it's pretty repetitive. TLDR: The flu spreads from person to person easily; we aren't sure exactly where the pandemic started in the US; lots of people died. PS please get your annual flu shot! - Emma
