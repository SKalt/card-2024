A true racist medical story that doesn't paint Hopkins in a good light. TLDR: Hopkins took cancer cells from Ms. Lacks, a poor black woman, without her consent and performed medical research with them and a lot of other people made a lot of money off of it. It's an excellent introductory lesson into racism in medicine, which unfortunately still persists. - Emma
