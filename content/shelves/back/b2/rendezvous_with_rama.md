Arthur C. Clarke tells about a team of astronauts exploring a maybe-abandoned alien spaceship, mixing classic-SF man-vs-space with speculation about what alien furniture would be like.

If you liked this book, I'd recommend [_Pushing Ice_ by Alstair Reynolds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89186.Pushing_Ice?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=PN8NRsqdIf&rank=1), which I thought was a much more enjoyable take on the concept.  If nothing else, Reynolds knows how to write about ancient alien ruins in space.
