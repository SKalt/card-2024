I'm almost a little embarassed to have this on our shelf. My grandmother, Paya, visited this year and perused our shelves and said that we had too much "high class literature." I'm thinking she didn't see this one. I haven't read it yet, but I am up-to-date on Bridgerton the Netflix series.  10 out of 10 would recommend if you enjoy period dramas with very good looking people. - Emma
