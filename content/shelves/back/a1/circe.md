Great book about the witch on the island from Homer's The Odyssey.  You don't need to have read or really remember anything from The Odyssey  to enjoy Circe.  I'm on a bit of a Greek myths retelling kick. I read Penelopiad by Margaret Atwood this year.  I would not recommend this one. It's a little too aggressively crapping on men for me. However, I also read Hera by Jennifer Saint this year, which was pretty good and I plan to read a few more by Saint in 2025. - Emma
