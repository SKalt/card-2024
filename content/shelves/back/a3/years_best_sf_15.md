I picked this up off the side of the road since I'm an incurable optimist. I kept it since it has a memorable story from Peter Watts in it:

> A spaceship hewn from an asteroid has a billion-year-long mission to build a wormhole network across the galaxy.
> Its crew remains frozen for millennia unless a job arises that's too complicated for automated systems to handle.
> It has been millions of years since anything remotely human came out of a recently-built wormhole or even tried to communicate.
> When the ship receives a signal, it wakes the crew up.


Since Watts publishes many of his works online, free of charge, you can read it here: [_The Island_ (2009)](https://rifters.com/real/shorts/PeterWatts_TheIsland.pdf). - Steven
