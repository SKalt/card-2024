I don't know if I like this one yet; I haven't read it. However, I've got a suspicion that I might:
1. I enjoyed another of Delany's stories, _Babel-17_.
2. William gibson wrote that Dhalgren was [one of his favorites](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/samuel-delany-science-fiction-cultural-pioneer-turns-75/#:~:text=William%20Gibson%20has,to%20be%20%E2%80%98solved%E2%80%99.%E2%80%9D).
3. After reading [a recent profile of Delany](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/10/samuel-r-delany-profile), I had to pick this one up.
