The Sequel to _Once a Runner_: now in his mid-30s, Quentin Cassidy pauses his career to train for the 1980s Olympic marathon trials. I read this while taking a break from working and training for the American Birkibinier, a ski marathon. It holds up to the original, and felt like the character had a better sense of how life was passing him by while he tried to cut out distractions to train. - Steven.
