I picked this book off the shelf at The Book Mill in Montague, MA because of the cover of the 50th anniversary edition; there's a cat on it.  Then, I read the recommendations on the inside, one of which was written by Daniel Radcliffe.  I would love nothing more than to be friends with Daniel Radcliffe; feel free to ask me about it sometime.  Anyway, this is a fun Russian novel with an interesting cast of characters. - Emma
