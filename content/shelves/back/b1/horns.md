The protagonist wakes one morning with horns growing out of his head that cause people to act on their worst impulses. The protagonist uses his new curse to search for his girlfriend's murderer.

Filled with puns, even if it's far from uplifting.

To give the story a little spice: [Joe Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hill_(writer)) is the pen name of Stephen King's son. Any parallels between the Maine setting and his upbringing are purely coincidental, I'm sure. - Steven (non-King version)
