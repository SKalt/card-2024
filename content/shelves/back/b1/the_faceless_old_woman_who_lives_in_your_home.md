Haven't read this one yet, but it is written by the same authors of _Welcome to Nightvale_ and _It Devours!_ which were both awesome.  You can read the books in any order, but I'd recommend starting with _Welcome to Nightvale_.  Nightvale, the town, is the main character in _Welcome to Nightvale_ and introduces the reader to the town's oddities.  At the time of the book photoshoot for this card, we did not have _Welcome to Nightvale_.  However, we have since acquired it over the Christmas holiday from a wonderful bookstore in NYC called _The Strand_ --shout out to Ian and Kata for the store recommendation. - Emma

Back when I regularly drove, I enjoyed the Welcome to Nightvale podcasts. For the uninitiated, Nightvale is a small town in the middle of the desert where all of the conspiracy theories are true at once.

Nightvale in any form is strange in ways that are hard to find elsewhere.

In other news, I recently heard someone on The Internet™️ refer to their Amazon Alexa device as _The Faceless Old Woman Who Lives in Your Home_: mostly invisible, but always listening. - Steven
