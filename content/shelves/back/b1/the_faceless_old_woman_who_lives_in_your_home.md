Haven't read this one yet, but it is written by the same authors of Welcome to Nightvale and It Devours! which were both awesome.  You can read the books in any order, but I'd recommend starting with Welcome to Nightvale.  Nightvale, the town, is the main character in Welcome to Nightvale and introduces the reader to the town oddities.  At the time of the book photoshoot for this card, we did not have Welcome to Nightvale.  However, we have since acquired it over the Christmas holiday from a wonderful bookstore in NYC called The Strand--shout out to Ian and Kata for the store recommendation. - Emma
