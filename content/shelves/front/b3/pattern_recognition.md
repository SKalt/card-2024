This book gave me the experience of being cool. Taking place sometime in the 00s, it feels relevant; weaponized marketing and the russian mob are timeless themes, apparently.
Despite several action sequences, Pattern Recognition is strangely devoid of a plot. Little that the main character says or does seems to have a lasting effect. I'm not sure if that's part of the book's charm, but Gibson's writing _definitely_ is. There are a couple aesthetically pleasing and strange phrases that I would never have strung together in there. - Steven
