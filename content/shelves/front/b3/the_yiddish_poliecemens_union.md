I tried reading Kavalier and Clay--another Chabon novel--at Steven's recommendation, but I couldn't get into it.  I then read Final Solution, which is a nice short story, and I found that I really liked Chabon's prose. This was my second completed Chabon novel. It's an alt-history, Jewish, crime novel. Interest not piqued yet? The main characters wife is a cool boss-lady.  Does that help? - Emma

In our world, there was a proposal around WWII to grant European Jews asylum in Alaska [[source]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Alaska#1940s_%E2%80%93_2000s). In this book, the plan happened. The story follows a hardboiled detective through the Alaskan city on the brink of reverting from a semi-sovereign state into the control of the U.S. You can practically smell the characters.

Also, at the end of the book there's an amazing pun. It's worth reading just for that. - Steven
