I tried reading Kavalier and Clay--another Chabon novel--at Steven's recommendation, but I couldn't get into it.  I then read Final Solution, which is a nice short story, and I found that I really liked Chabon's prose. This was my second completed Chabon novel. It's an alt-history, Jewish, crime novel. Interest not piqued yet? The main characters wife is a cool boss-lady.  Does that help? - Emma
