This is one of the foundational books in the Cyberpunk genre. It ticks all the boxes:
- [x] a dystopian world
- [x] due to virtual reality
- [x] filled with hackers
- [x] who hack both brains and machines
- [x] also there are ninjas, for whatever reason

Mark Zuckerberg in his infinite wisdom saw this book, complete with a protagonist named "Hiro Protagonist", and said, yeah I'm going to spend several billion dollars trying to recreate the tech from that story.

This interaction between fiction and glue-sniffing CEOs was best summed up by a 2021 twitter user:

> Sci-Fi Author: In my book I invented the Torment Nexus as a cautionary tale
>
> Tech Company: At long last, we have created the Torment Nexus from the classic Sci-Fi novel "Don't Create the Torment Nexus"
