So good.  Read this for the first time in 2022 or 2023 and was my first venture into Sci-Fi. Definitely would recommend.  The anatomic stuff is pretty accurate too. - Emma

I know F.V. holds up since I made Emma read it and she enjoyed it (unlike that time I made her watch the Matrix -- and she had a point).
Plus, it was likely an inspiration for The Magic School Bus. - Steven
