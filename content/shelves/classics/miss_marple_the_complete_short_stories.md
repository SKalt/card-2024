Agatha Christie is my guilty pleasure read. I NEVER figure out whodunit until the reveal.  I feel dumb everytime, and I don't care. And Then There Were None was my first venture into Agatha Christie, and I think it is still my favorite.  However, any Poirot story is entertaining, but that's because he's basically Sherlock Holmes, which I also thoroughly enjoy.  Steven is partial to Miss Marple.  I read one story so far where she is the main detective and my take away is that when I get old, I can sit in our kitchen and solve murders like her too. - Emma
