Another classic. I really enjoyed this one. There is a really artsy chapter somewhere in the middle.  If that's not your cup of tea, you can totally skip it.  You'll know it when you get there.  I skipped it and the book still made complete sense.  Maybe in 2025, I'll try to read it again from cover to cover. - Emma
