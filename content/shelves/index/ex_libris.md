An excellent book about books. We read this excerpt at our wedding:

> Our library was in impeccable order, but it was a little airless, much as my own life had been before George entered it.  And so, by subtle degrees, as the weeks passed George's style began to retake the upper hand in a not entirely unwelcome fashion. As the excessively rectilinear foundation lines of a few house are softened by the addition of a few windblown weeds here, a knocked-over tricycle there, so the flawlessness of our new system was softened by the forces of entropy and my husband, who are closely allied. Our bedside tables started to sag under the weight of new, unsorted volumes. The Shakespeares reshuffled. One day I noticed that the Iliad and the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire had somehow found their way to the Friends and Relatives section. Confronted with the evidence, George crossed his fingers and said, "Well. Gibbon and I were like that".
>
> A couple weeks ago, when George was out of town, I decided to reread Travels with Charley.  I got into bed with the copy I had first read the summer I turned seventeen.  I was settling into the familiar feel of my crumbly old paperback, the one with Steinbeck sitting cross-legged next to his poodle on the cover, when I reached page 192.  There, next to a passage about the dwindling redwood forests of California, in a younger version of my husband's handwriting -- I'd recognize it anywhere -- was the plaintive comment "Why do we destroy the environment?"
>
> We must have had identical copies and we'd kept George's. My books and his books had become our books. We were really married.
