I had been searching for a copy of this book for a year and change when I found it in a bookshop in Edinburgh, hometown of the first of the characters in the title.

Similar to how The Lord of the Rings pretends to be a translation, J.S&M.N. pretends to be a history book filled with fairy tales in the footnotes.

The B.B.C. adaptation was passable since the characters are lively. However, the parts of the book that stick with me can't be put into film. - Steven
